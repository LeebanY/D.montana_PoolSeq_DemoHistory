# Demographic history of D.montana using Pool-seq from Parker et al (2018).

Project aims: Populations of *D.montana* show some evidence of reproductive isolation, particularly in the Colorado population, which shows asymmetric PMPZ isolation with other populations. This project aims to date time of genetic divergence, if/when gene flow ceased, and effective population size.
